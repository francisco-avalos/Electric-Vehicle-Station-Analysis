# Purpose
This work aims to add informative details to the library of knowledge on the application
of statistical methods to the management of EV charging stations (EVCS). Specifically, we
intend to provide insights to help better manage when an EVCS will enter a maintenance
period that renders it unusable for customers’ EV charging. When we can better predict when
a station will go into maintenance, support teams from these organizations and businesses
can coordinate most efficiently to jump-start the EV station back into operation; and in
doing so, expand the accessible time window for customers’ EV charging needs.
